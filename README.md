# NaTruKi OOP Project
This project is a C++ application developed by NaTruKi Team from [Faculty of Information Technology at Vietnam National University - University of Science](fit.hcmus.edu.vn). The application's core is built entirely in C++, emphasizing the use of Object-Oriented Design Patterns. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is implemented using the Qt5 framework.

## About The Project
Welcome to our **SVG Viewer** project! This application is the result of a dedicated effort by the **NaTruKi Team**, students in the **24CTT6** class.

This project was conceived not just to build a functional tool, but as a deep dive into **software architecture.** The entire application is written in **C++**, with a core philosophy centered around the practical application of **OOP design patterns** to solve real-world problems. The **Graphic User Interface (GUI)** is powered by the cross-platform **Qt5 frameworks**, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience.
